## What API do I use for translation
I'm using Yandex Cloud API, which offers access to [Yandex Translator](translate.yandex.ru) service.

## About the bot
First send `/start` to start the bot. \
To translate a text, it's enough to send it as a message, the bot will reply with the translation \
The bot translates to English by default, You can change the language by sending `/choose_language`. \
Also you don't have to specify source language because Yandex API offers the feature of identifying languages! \
For help send `/help`, the bot will print the help message, explaining commands and how to translate. \
